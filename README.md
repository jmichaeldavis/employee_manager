# employee_manager

## Description
This project is solely a back end appplication. A front end interface is not included. It allows the user to use Inquirer to manage their employees. 
## Installation and Usage
To use this, the user must do 'npm i' to install the packages, run the schema.sql and seeds.sql files in mysql to add the database. Afterwards, running 'node server.js' will launch inquirer. The user can then go through the various prompts and manage all the employees as well as add and customize to the roles, departments, and employees.
